## Prompt

I am an over 60 800 m runner, to improve my pace I have started short sprints, but I often pull this muscle above the knee on the back of the leg closer to the inside see image.. other than sprinting non of my regular weight leg curls or workouts stress this muscle other than full extension sprinting or deceleration, braking feom a sprint. Can you guve me 4 exercises weights etc that wiuld train this muscle without sprinting. Can you give me links also to the exercises

That looks like a significant bruise, which often points to a strain or partial tear of the medial hamstrings (specifically the semitendinosus or semimembranosus).

As a runner over 60, your muscle fibers have different elasticity than they once did. Sprinting—especially the "snap" of full extension and the heavy eccentric load of braking—demands massive force from these tendons. Since your standard leg curls aren't hitting the spot, you likely need eccentric-focused movements that mimic the "braking" action and movements that engage the hamstrings while the hip is extended.

Here are four exercises to target that specific area:

1. Nordic Hamstring Curls
This is the "gold standard" for preventing sprint-related injuries. It specifically trains the muscle to handle the force during the "braking" phase of your stride.

The Move: Kneel on a soft surface with your ankles secured (by a partner or under a heavy weight bench). Slowly lower your torso toward the floor, resisting gravity as long as possible using only your hamstrings. Catch yourself with your hands.

Why it works: It builds extreme eccentric strength, which is exactly where you are currently failing during deceleration.

2. Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)
Standard leg curls work the hamstrings via knee flexion, but sprinting requires them to work via hip extension.

The Move: Stand on one leg with a slight bend in the knee. Hinge at the hips, sending your butt back and lowering a weight (or just your hands) toward the floor while keeping your back flat.

Why it works: By doing this single-legged, you force the medial hamstrings to stabilize the knee, preventing the "pull" you feel on the inside of the leg.

3. Stability Ball Hamstring Curls
This bridges the gap between a weight machine and a sprint.

The Move: Lie on your back with your heels on a stability ball. Lift your hips into a bridge. While keeping your hips high, curl the ball toward your glutes and then—crucially—slowly extend your legs back out.

Why it works: It requires the hamstrings to work while the hips are in extension, which mimics the posture of a runner much better than a seated machine.

4. Glute-Ham Bridge (with Isometric Holds)
If the muscle is currently injured, isometric (holding) exercises are a great way to build tendon resilience without the "snap" of movement.

The Move: Perform a glute bridge but walk your feet out further away from your body so the knees are only slightly bent. Hold this position for 30–60 seconds.

Why it works: Hamstring pulls often happen when the leg is nearly straight (full extension). This strengthens the muscle in that specific vulnerable "long" position.

A Quick "Peer" Note
Given the size of that hematoma (the bruising), it would be wise to have a physical therapist check if there’s a high-grade tear. At 60+, the risk of a tendon avulsion (where the muscle pulls slightly away from the bone) is higher.




### Claude

The muscle you're pulling is likely your semimembranosus or semitendinosus - the medial (inner) hamstrings. These are particularly vulnerable during the terminal swing phase of sprinting and during rapid deceleration because they work eccentrically to control knee extension and help brake your forward motion.
Here are 4 targeted exercises to strengthen this area:
1. Nordic Hamstring Curls (Eccentric Focus)

Kneel on a pad, anchor your ankles (partner holds them or use a loaded barbell)
Keep hips extended, slowly lower your torso forward as far as controlled
Use your hands to catch yourself, push back up to assist
Start with 3 sets of 3-5 reps, progress to 8-10 reps
This is the gold standard for hamstring injury prevention

2. Single-Leg Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)

Hold a dumbbell in one hand, stand on opposite leg
Hinge at hip, keeping slight knee bend, lower weight toward floor
Focus on controlled descent and feeling stretch in hamstring
3 sets of 8-12 reps per leg
Builds eccentric strength in lengthened position

3. Slider/Swiss Ball Leg Curls

Lie on back, heels on sliders or swiss ball
Bridge hips up, then curl heels toward glutes
Slowly extend legs back out (eccentric phase is key)
To emphasize medial hamstrings: turn toes slightly outward
3 sets of 10-15 reps
Trains hamstrings through full range of motion

4. Terminal Knee Extension Drops (Eccentric)

Stand on step/box (6-12 inches)
Slowly lower one leg down behind you in a controlled manner
Keep working leg slightly bent, resist the eccentric lowering
3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg
Mimics the braking action that causes your pulls

Key principles for you:

Prioritize the eccentric (lowering) phase - that's where sprint injuries occur
Start conservatively and progress gradually over 4-6 weeks
Do these 2-3x per week on non-sprint days
Consider reducing sprint volume temporarily while building this strength base

Given your age and injury pattern, also ensure you're warming up thoroughly before sprints and consider limiting true max-effort sprints to once weekly until this area is more resilient.



### ChatGPT

Got it — that location (back of the thigh, above the knee and toward the inside) lines up really well with the medial hamstrings, especially semitendinosus / semimembranosus. Those muscles get hammered during late swing → braking → terminal knee extension, which explains why sprinting and deceleration trigger it while curls don’t.

You’re not broken — you’ve just found a gap between gym strength and sprint-specific loading 👍
Below are 4 exercises that target that exact tissue without sprinting, and without needing crazy loads.

1️⃣ Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Medial Bias)

Best overall carryover

Why it works
This loads the hamstring long while the knee is slightly bent, which is exactly where sprint injuries happen.

How to bias the inside hamstring

Hold dumbbell or kettlebell in the opposite hand of the working leg

Let the working knee track slightly inward (don’t force it)

Prescription

Load: moderate (you should feel stretch + control)

Tempo: 4 sec down / 1 sec up

3–4 sets × 6–8 reps each leg

If you feel it just above the knee on the inside, you’re doing it right.

2️⃣ Slider Hamstring Curl (Eccentric Emphasis)

<img width="1000" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d09128-fb02-4f38-9e87-9f1ebcc724e4" />

Very sprint-specific without sprinting

(Use socks on hardwood, towels on tile, or furniture sliders.)

Why it works
This trains knee-extension braking, the exact moment you’re getting injured.

How

Start hips high (bridge)

Slowly slide heels away from you

Drop hips if needed on the way back

Prescription

5–6 second eccentric

3 sets × 5–8 reps

Stop before cramping, not after

This is gold for masters runners.

3️⃣ Seated Hamstring Isometric (Near Full Extension)

<img width="194" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5cac83a-270f-402b-b3bf-8d40c805c6ca" />

Tendon + muscle protection

Why it works
Sprinting injuries often involve force at long length — isometrics here build tolerance without strain.

How

Sit tall, knee ~20–30° from full extension

Dig heel into floor or strap it under a heavy object

Pull as hard as you can without pain

Prescription

4–5 reps × 20–30 sec holds

2–3 sets

Pain ≤ 2/10

This one protects you when sprinting comes back.

4️⃣ Reverse Nordic (Hamstring-Assisted Version)

Deceleration training

Why it works
Trains posterior chain braking through the knee — very similar to slowing down from a sprint.

Hamstring-friendly version

Keep hips slightly hinged

Don’t stay upright like a quad-only reverse Nordic

Stop before knee pain

Prescription

Bodyweight or light band assist

3 sets × 5–8 slow reps

5 sec lowering

How to Plug This Into Your Training

For an over-60 800 m runner, I’d suggest:

2× per week

Exercise 1 or 2 (alternate weeks)

Exercise 3 every session

Exercise 4 once per week

Rule of thumb

If it doesn’t challenge the muscle at long length, it won’t protect you at sprint speed.

Extra (Very Important)

Warm up with A-marches and A-skips, not static stretching

Avoid sprinting from cold or fatigued states

First sprint session back → 90–95%, not all-out
